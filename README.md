# ppo-cleanrl-continuous-control-halfcheetahv4
clean, modular implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for continuous action spaces using PyTorch and Gymnasium.
Inspired by CleanRL
, this script demonstrates a minimal yet complete PPO training loop for environments like HalfCheetah-v4, including:

Orthogonal weight initialization

GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)

Learning rate annealing

Gradient clipping

TensorBoard logging
